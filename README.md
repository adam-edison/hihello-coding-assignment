## Timing

Start Time: 7:50 pm ET
End Time: 10:00 pm ET
Time Spent: 2.0 hrs

## Testing

Tested on WSL2 with:

- nvm version 0.39.5
- npm version 8.19.3
- node version 19.1.0

### NOTES

#### Time Constraints

- Although I was able to complete the 4 basic functions of a calculator, I was unable to complete everything I would have liked to in 2 hrs
- I think I spent too long setting up my environment (~45 min)

#### Items Completed

- All four basic operators `(+, -, *, /)`
- Evaluation of last operation with `=`

```
0
> 5+8=
13
> =
21
```

#### Items Not Yet Completed

- Not yet completed: (time estimates)
  - negative numbers input using `!` (5 min)
  - clear button as `c` (5 min)
  - multiple operation support, e.g. `5-8+12=`, (15 min)
  - sussing out potential bugs with `float` numbers (15 min)
  - edge cases with large numbers, e.g. overflow MAX_INTEGER value (5 min)
  - edge cases with negative numbers (5 min)
  - edge case with dividing by zero (5 min)
